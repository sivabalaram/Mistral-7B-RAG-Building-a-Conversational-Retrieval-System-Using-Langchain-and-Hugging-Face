# Mistral-7B-RAG-Building-a-Conversational-Retrieval-System-Using-Langchain-and-Hugging-Face
Summary:
This script sets up a conversational retrieval system using the Langchain and Hugging Face libraries. It installs necessary dependencies, loads a PDF document, and splits it into smaller chunks for easier processing. The script then uses Hugging Face embeddings to convert the text chunks into embeddings, which are stored and retrieved using the Chroma vector database. It employs the Mistral-7B model from Hugging Face for answering questions based on the document content. The system runs in an infinite loop, allowing users to input questions and receive answers until they choose to exit. The conversational history is maintained throughout the session to provide context for the responses.
